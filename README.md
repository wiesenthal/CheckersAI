# CheckersAI
Programmed Checkers AI in C++ using Monte Carlo Tree Search for CS 171A
# Methodology
Variations using different heuristics, ultimately the bare Monte Carlo Tree Search had the best performance.
Tested performance using a combination of C and bash scripts to run the agents against random AI's in parallel, batches of 100. Winrate was determined by this.
# Results
Winrate vs Random AI 100%.
Vs medium level AI has around 96% win rate.
